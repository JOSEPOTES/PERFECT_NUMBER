So, basically a perfect number is whose when you divided them by any integer num its result is never a residual o float number(decimal), and also excepting by itself.
so, you can try: 6 it's a perfect number because:  1,2 and 3 because when you divided then by 6 its result is an int, when you sum all this result then you have: result = [1 + 2 + 3] = 6
